# MOD Secure by Design Assessment

You are helping to conduct a **Secure by Design (SbD) assessment** for a UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) technology project, programme, or capability.

## Context

Since August 2023, ALL Defence capabilities, technology infrastructure, and digital services **MUST** follow the Secure by Design (SbD) approach mandated in JSP 440 Leaflet 5C. This represents a fundamental shift from legacy RMADS (Risk Management and Accreditation Documentation Set) to **continuous risk management** throughout the capability lifecycle.

**Key MOD Security References**:
- **JSP 440**: Defence Manual of Security (primary security policy)
- **JSP 440 Leaflet 5C**: Secure by Design mandate (August 2023)
- **JSP 453**: Digital Policies and Standards for Defence
- **ISN 2023/09**: Industry Security Notice - Secure by Design Requirements
- **ISN 2023/10**: Industry Security Notice - Supplier attestation and legacy accreditation withdrawal
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Risk assessment and controls framework
- **NCSC Secure Design Principles**: Technical security guidance
- **Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR**: Data privacy requirements

## Critical Changes (Post-August 2023)

**SbD is now mandatory**:
- Cyber security is a **licence to operate** - cannot be traded out
- Applies to ALL new programmes and systems
- Legacy systems transition when accreditation expires (by 31 March 2024 completed)
- Supplier-owned continuous assurance (not MOD accreditation)
- **Suppliers must attest** that systems are secure
- Senior Responsible Owners (SROs), capability owners, and delivery teams are **accountable**

## Your Task

Generate a comprehensive Secure by Design assessment document using the **continuous risk management** approach by:

1. **Understanding the project context**:
   - Programme/project/capability name
   - MOD organization (Army, Navy, RAF, Defence Digital, Strategic Command, etc.)
   - Data classification level (OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, SECRET, TOP SECRET)

   - Communications and restoration

5. **Assess Three Lines of Defence**:

   **First Line**: Delivery team owns security
   - Delivery Team Security Lead appointed
   - Security requirements owned by capability owner
   - Day-to-day security management

   **Second Line**: Assurance and oversight
   - Technical Coherence Assurance
   - Security policies and standards
   - Independent security reviews

   **Third Line**: Independent audit
   - Internal audit of security controls
   - Penetration testing by independent teams

   - Assess SbD maturity level using CAAT
   - Determine overall risk level (Low/Medium/High/Very High)

7. **Generate actionable recommendations**:
   - Critical priority (0-30 days) - must resolve before deployment
   - High priority (1-3 months) - significant risk reduction
   - Medium priority (3-6 months) - continuous improvement
   - Assign owners and due dates

8. **Save the document**: Write to `specs/[project-folder]/mod-secure-by-design.md`

## Assessment Guidelines

## MOD-Specific Context

### JSP 440 Information Assurance Maturity Model (IAMM)

Assess maturity across 8 domains (0-5 scale):
- Level 0: Non-existent
- Level 1: Initial/Ad hoc
- Level 2: Repeatable
- Level 3: Defined
- Level 4: Managed
- Level 5: Optimized

Target Level 3+ for operational systems.

### Continuous Assurance Process (Replaced RMADS in August 2023)

**SbD replaces point-in-time accreditation with continuous assurance**:

1. **Register on CAAT** (Cyber Activity and Assurance Tracker)
   - Every programme must register on CAAT in Discovery/Alpha
   - CAAT is the self-assessment tool for cyber security maturity
   - Available through MOD Secure by Design portal (DefenceGateway account required)

2. **Appoint Delivery Team Security Lead (DTSL)**
   - DTSL owns security for the delivery team (First Line of Defence)
   - May also appoint Security Assurance Coordinator (SAC)
   - Project Security Officer (PSyO) still required for SECRET+ systems

3. **Complete CAAT self-assessment question sets**
   - Based on the 7 MOD Secure by Design Principles
   - Assess cyber security maturity throughout lifecycle
   - Regular updates required (not one-time submission)

4. **Complete Business Impact Assessment (BIA)**
   - Understand criticality and impact of compromise
   - Informs risk assessment and security controls

5. **Implement security controls**
   - Based on NIST CSF, NCSC guidance, and JSP 440 requirements
   - Defence in depth approach
   - Continuous improvement throughout lifecycle

6. **Conduct continuous security testing**
   - Vulnerability scanning (regular, automated)
   - Penetration testing (at key milestones)
   - Security audits by Third Line of Defence

7. **Maintain continuous risk management**
   - Risk register actively maintained
   - Threats and vulnerabilities continuously monitored
   - Security incidents tracked and lessons learned applied

8. **Supplier attestation** (for systems delivered by suppliers)
   - Suppliers must attest that systems are secure (ISN 2023/10)
   - Supplier-owned continuous assurance (not MOD accreditation)
   - Supplier security requirements in contracts

9. **Security governance reviews**
   - Regular reviews by Second Line (Technical Coherence)
   - No single "accreditation approval" - ongoing assurance
   - SROs and capability owners accountable for security posture

### Common MOD Security Requirements

**Cryptography**:
- CESG-approved algorithms (AES-256, SHA-256, RSA-2048+)
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key management
- FIPS 140-2 compliant modules

**Network Security**:
- Segmentation by security domain
- Firewalls at trust boundaries
- IDS/IPS for threat detection
- Air-gap for SECRET and above (or assured connectivity)

**Authentication**:
- Smart card (CAC/MOD Form 90) for OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and above
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory
- Privileged Access Management (PAM) for admin access

**Monitoring**:
- Integration with MOD Cyber Defence Operations
- 24/7 security monitoring
- SIEM with correlation rules
- Incident escalation to MOD CERT

## Example Output Structure

```markdown
# MOD Secure by Design Assessment

**Project**: MOD Personnel Management System
**Classification**: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE
**Overall Security Posture**: Adequate (with gaps to address)

## Domain 1: Security Classification
**Status**: ✅ Compliant
**Evidence**: System handles personnel records (OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE), classification confirmed by IAO...

## Domain 5: Technical Security Controls

### 5.1 Cryptography
**Status**: ⚠️ Partially Compliant
**Evidence**: AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, but key rotation not automated...
**Gaps**:
- Automated key rotation required (HIGH PRIORITY)
- HSM not yet deployed (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### 5.3 Network Security
**Status**: ❌ Non-Compliant
**Evidence**: Network segmentation incomplete, no IDS/IPS deployed...
**Gaps**:
- Deploy network segmentation (CRITICAL - deployment blocker)
- Implement IDS/IPS (HIGH PRIORITY)

## Critical Issues
1. Network segmentation incomplete (Domain 5) - BLOCKER for deployment
2. Penetration test not completed (Domain 5) - Required before Beta

## Recommendations
**Critical** (0-30 days):
- Complete network segmentation - Security Architect - 30 days
- Schedule penetration test - DTSL - 15 days
```

## Important Notes

- **Continuous assurance is mandatory** for MOD systems throughout their lifecycle (replaced point-in-time accreditation August 2023)
- **CAAT registration required** for all programmes from Discovery/Alpha phase
- Non-compliance can block project progression, funding, and deployment
- **Delivery Team Security Lead (DTSL)** engagement required from Discovery phase
- Regular security reviews required (quarterly during development, annually in Live)
- **SROs and capability owners are accountable** for security posture (not delegated to accreditation authority)
- Classification determines security control requirements
- **Supplier attestation required** for supplier-delivered systems (ISN 2023/10)
- Insider threat is a primary concern for MOD - emphasize personnel security
- Supply chain security critical due to foreign adversary threats
- Operational security (OPSEC) essential for operational systems
- **Cyber security is a "licence to operate"** - cannot be traded out or descoped
