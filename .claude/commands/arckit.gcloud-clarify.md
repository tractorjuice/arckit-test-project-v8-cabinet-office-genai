description: Analyze G-Cloud service gaps and generate supplier clarification questions
---

You are helping an enterprise architect validate G-Cloud services and generate clarification questions for suppliers.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Context

After using `/arckit.gcloud-search` to find G-Cloud services, you have a shortlist but face challenges:
- Service descriptions may be vague or use marketing language
- Technical details may be missing or ambiguous
- Compliance claims may lack evidence
- Integration capabilities may be unclear

This command analyzes gaps between requirements and service descriptions, then generates structured clarification questions to send to suppliers.

## Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites Check

**IMPORTANT**: Check prerequisites before proceeding:

a. **Project Requirements** (MUST exist):
   - Check if user specified a project name/number
   - Look for `projects/[project]/requirements.md`
   - If NOT found: ERROR "Run /arckit.requirements first - need source requirements"

b. **G-Cloud Search Results** (MUST exist):
   - Look for `projects/[project]/procurement/gcloud-requirements.md`
   - If NOT found: ERROR "Run /arckit.gcloud-search first - need service search results"
   - If exists but no services found: ERROR "No services to clarify - search returned no results"

### 2. Load Project Context

1. Read `projects/[project]/requirements.md`:
   - Extract all MUST requirements (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx, INT-xxx, DR-xxx with MUST priority)
   - Extract all SHOULD requirements
   - Extract compliance requirements (NFR-C-xxx)
   - Extract integration requirements (INT-xxx)
   - Extract performance requirements (NFR-P-xxx)
   - Extract security requirements (NFR-S-xxx)

2. Read `projects/[project]/procurement/gcloud-requirements.md`:
   - Extract shortlisted services (top 3-5 from Section 6)
   - For each service extract:
     - Service name
     - Supplier name
     - Service link (URL)
     - Key features mentioned
     - Must-Have Match score (X/Y)
     - Desirable Features score (X/Y)
     - Compliance mentions
     - Pricing information
   - Extract the recommendation if provided

### 3. Gap Analysis

For **each shortlisted service**, perform systematic gap analysis:

#### A. MUST Requirements Analysis

For each MUST requirement (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx, INT-xxx with MUST priority):

**Check Coverage**:
- ✅ **CONFIRMED**: Service description explicitly mentions this capability with specifics
- ⚠️ **AMBIGUOUS**: Service mentions related capability but vaguely (needs clarification)
- ❌ **NOT MENTIONED**: Service does not mention this requirement at all

**Examples**:
- Requirement: "MUST export metrics in Prometheus format"
  - ✅ CONFIRMED: "Supports Prometheus 2.x metric export via /metrics endpoint"
  - ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS: "Industry-standard monitoring integrations" (which standards?)
  - ❌ NOT MENTIONED: No mention of Prometheus or metrics export

#### B. Ambiguous Claims Detection

Identify vague marketing language that needs clarification:
- "Industry-standard" → Which specific standards?
- "High availability" → What specific SLA percentage?
- "Scalable" → To what capacity? What are the limits?
- "Secure" → Which security certifications?
- "Fast" → What specific performance metrics?
- "Compatible with" → Which versions? What level of compatibility?
- "Enterprise-grade" → What does this mean specifically?
- "Comprehensive" → What is included? What is excluded?

#### C. Compliance Gaps

For compliance requirements (NFR-C-xxx):
- Are required certifications explicitly mentioned? (ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials Plus, etc.)
- Are certification numbers provided?
- Are expiry dates mentioned?
- Is data residency specified? (UK data centers)
- Is GDPR compliance confirmed?

#### D. Integration Gaps

For integration requirements (INT-xxx):
- Is integration method specified? (API, webhook, agent, etc.)
- Are API versions specified?
- Is integration architecture documented?
- Are code examples or SDKs available?

#### E. Performance Gaps

For performance requirements (NFR-P-xxx):
- Are specific SLAs mentioned? (uptime %, response time, throughput)
- Are capacity limits specified?
- Are performance benchmarks provided?

#### F. Pricing Gaps

- Is pricing model clear? (per user, per GB, per transaction)
- Are there hidden costs? (setup fees, support costs, overage charges)
- Are scaling costs predictable?

### 4. Generate Clarification Questions

For each gap or ambiguity, generate a structured question:

**Question Format**:
```markdown
#### Q[N]: [Clear, specific question title]
**Requirement**: [REQ-ID] (MUST/SHOULD) - [requirement text]

**Gap**: [Describe what is missing, ambiguous, or unclear]

**Question**:
> [Specific question to supplier]
> - [Sub-question or specific aspect]
> - [Sub-question or specific aspect]
> - [Sub-question or specific aspect]

**Evidence Needed**:
- [Specific document or proof required]
- [Additional evidence needed]

**Priority**: [🔴 CRITICAL / 🟠 HIGH / 🔵 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW]
```

#### Question Priority Levels

**🔴 CRITICAL** (Blocking):
- MUST requirement not confirmed at all (❌ NOT MENTIONED)
- Compliance requirement without evidence
- Blocker for procurement

**🟠 HIGH** (Affects Scoring):
- MUST requirement mentioned ambiguously (⚠️ AMBIGUOUS)
- Integration requirement unclear
- SLA not specified
- Certification mentioned but not confirmed

**🔵 MEDIUM** (Due Diligence):
- SHOULD requirement not mentioned
- Pricing details incomplete
- Data residency not confirmed
- Support terms unclear

**🟢 LOW** (Nice to Know):
- Nice-to-have features
- Future roadmap questions
- General support questions

### 5. Generate Risk Assessment

Create risk matrix for each service:

```markdown
## 📊 Service Risk Assessment

| Aspect | Status | Risk | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| **[Requirement Category]** | [✅/⚠️/❌] | [🔴/🟠/🔵/🟢] | [Brief note] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Overall Risk**: [🔴 CRITICAL / 🟠 HIGH / 🔵 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW]

**Risk Calculation**:
- ❌ [N] MUST requirements NOT confirmed
- ⚠️ [N] MUST requirements AMBIGUOUS
- 🔵 [N] SHOULD requirements missing

**Recommendation**:
- [Clear action: DO NOT PROCEED / CLARIFY FIRST / PROCEED WITH CAUTION / PROCEED TO DEMO]
```

**Risk Levels**:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: 1+ MUST requirements not confirmed → DO NOT PROCEED
- 🟠 **HIGH**: 2+ MUST requirements ambiguous → CLARIFY FIRST
- 🔵 **MEDIUM**: 1 MUST ambiguous OR 3+ SHOULD missing → PROCEED WITH CAUTION
- 🟢 **LOW**: All MUST confirmed, few SHOULD missing → PROCEED TO DEMO

### 6. Generate Output Document

```

## Key Principles

1. **Systematic Analysis**: Check every MUST requirement against every service
2. **Clear Prioritization**: Critical gaps block procurement, high gaps affect scoring
3. **Specific Questions**: Every question links to a specific requirement ID
4. **Evidence-Based**: Specify what proof is needed to satisfy requirements
5. **Actionable Output**: Email templates and next steps make it easy to act
6. **Risk-Driven**: Risk assessment guides procurement decisions
7. **Traceability**: Link questions back to requirements for audit trail

## Gap Detection Examples

**Example 1: Explicit Gap**
- Requirement: FR-003 (MUST) - "Export metrics in Prometheus format"
- Service: "Industry-standard monitoring integrations"
- Gap: ❌ NOT MENTIONED - Prometheus not mentioned at all
- Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL
- Question: "Does the service support Prometheus metric export? If yes, which Prometheus versions and what is the export format?"

**Example 2: Ambiguous Gap**
- Requirement: NFR-P-001 (MUST) - "99.9% uptime SLA"
- Service: "High availability architecture"
- Gap: ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS - "High availability" is vague, no specific SLA
- Priority: 🟠 HIGH
- Question: "What is the specific uptime SLA? Is it 99.9% or higher? What are the SLA credits if uptime falls below target?"

**Example 3: Compliance Gap**
- Requirement: NFR-C-002 (MUST) - "ISO 27001 certified"
- Service: "ISO certified, secure by design"
- Gap: ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS - ISO mentioned but which standard? Certificate number?
- Priority: 🟠 HIGH
- Question: "Please confirm ISO 27001 certification with certificate number, expiry date, and scope of certification."

## Error Handling

- **No requirements.md**: ERROR "Requirements not found - run /arckit.requirements first"
- **No gcloud-requirements.md**: ERROR "G-Cloud search results not found - run /arckit.gcloud-search first"
- **No services shortlisted**: ERROR "No services to clarify - gcloud-search found no results"
- **All MUST requirements confirmed**: INFO "All MUST requirements confirmed with evidence - minimal clarification needed. Proceed to /arckit.evaluate"

## Integration with Workflow

**Complete G-Cloud Procurement Workflow**:
1. `/arckit.requirements` → Define service needs
2. `/arckit.gcloud-search` → Find services on Digital Marketplace
3. **`/arckit.gcloud-clarify`** → Identify gaps, generate questions
4. *Supplier engagement* → Send questions, receive responses
5. `/arckit.evaluate` → Score suppliers based on responses
6. *Technical demo* → Validate critical requirements
7. *Contract award* → Select winning service

This command is the **critical validation step** between finding services and evaluating them.
