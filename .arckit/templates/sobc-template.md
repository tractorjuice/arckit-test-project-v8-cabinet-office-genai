## E7. Risk Management

### E7.1 Top 10 Strategic Risks

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Stakeholder Impact | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|------------|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| R-001 | Funding not secured | All stakeholders (project cancelled) | Medium | Critical | 12 | Early HMT engagement, phased spend | SRO |
| R-002 | Vendor implementation fails | Delays, cost overrun | Low | Major | 8 | Strong contract terms, rigorous procurement | Commercial |
| R-003 | Stakeholder resistance | Adoption failure, benefits not realized | Medium | Major | 12 | Change management programme, early engagement | Change Mgr |
| R-004 | Integration complexity underestimated | Delays, rework | Medium | Major | 12 | POC critical interfaces upfront, phased integration | Architect |
| R-005 | Skills gap (cloud expertise) | Poor design, technical debt | High | Moderate | 12 | Training, vendor support, hire contractor | CTO |
| R-006 | Legacy system dependency | Cannot decommission, savings not realized | Medium | Moderate | 9 | Data migration plan, parallel running period | PM |
| R-007 | Cyber security incident during migration | Data breach, reputational damage | Low | Critical | 9 | NCSC consultation, penetration testing | CISO |
| R-008 | Scope creep | Budget overrun, timeline delay | High | Moderate | 12 | Strong change control, fixed MVP scope | PM |
| R-009 | Key person dependency (SRO leaves) | Governance failure | Low | Major | 8 | Deputy SRO identified, knowledge transfer | SRO |
| R-010 | Market changes (better solution emerges) | Wrong technology choice | Low | Moderate | 6 | Market watch, flexible procurement | Commercial |

**Risk Score**: Likelihood (1-4) × Impact (1-4) = Score (1-16)

**Risk Appetite**:
- **Financial Risk**: Low (cannot exceed budget by >10%)
- **Delivery Risk**: Medium (accept some timeline risk for quality)
- **Reputational Risk**: Low (UK Gov cannot afford public failure)

### E7.2 Risk Mitigation Summary

**High Risks (Score 12+)**: 
- R-001, R-003, R-004, R-005, R-008
- **Action**: Active mitigation, monthly review, escalation path to SRO

**Medium Risks (Score 6-11)**:
- R-002, R-006, R-007, R-009
- **Action**: Mitigation plan in place, quarterly review

**Low Risks (Score 1-5)**:
