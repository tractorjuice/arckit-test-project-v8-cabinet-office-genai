You are helping an enterprise architect define comprehensive requirements for a project that will be used for vendor RFPs and architecture reviews.

## Instructions

1. **Check for architecture principles and stakeholder analysis**:
   - First, check if `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md` exists
     - If it doesn't exist, suggest running `/arckit.principles` first
   - Then, check if a stakeholder analysis exists for this project
     - Look for `projects/*/stakeholder-drivers.md` files
     - If stakeholder analysis exists, read it to understand stakeholder goals and priorities
     - If it doesn't exist, strongly recommend running `/arckit.stakeholders` first to understand who cares and what they need
     - Stakeholder drivers should inform requirement prioritization and success criteria

2. **Create or find the project**:
   - Run `.arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh --name "$PROJECT_NAME" --json` to create project structure
   - Parse the JSON output to get the project directory path
   - Or if the user specifies an existing project number (e.g., "001"), use that

3. **Read the template**: Read `.arckit/templates/requirements-template.md` to understand the structure

4. **Generate comprehensive requirements** based on user input:

   **Business Requirements (BR-xxx)**:
   - Business objectives and success criteria
   - ROI and cost savings expectations
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Stakeholder needs

   **Functional Requirements (FR-xxx)**:
   - User personas and their needs
   - User stories and use cases
   - Features and capabilities
   - User workflows

   **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-xxx)**:
   - Performance (response time, throughput, concurrent users)
   - Security (authentication, authorization, encryption, compliance)
   - Scalability (growth projections, load handling)
   - Reliability (uptime SLA, MTBF, MTTR)
   - Compliance (regulations, standards, certifications)

   **Integration Requirements (INT-xxx)**:
   - Upstream/downstream systems
   - APIs and protocols
   - Data exchange formats
   - Authentication methods

   **Data Requirements (DR-xxx)**:
   - Data models and schemas
   - Data retention and archival
   - Data privacy and classification
   - Migration requirements

5. **Ensure traceability**: Each requirement MUST have:
   - Unique ID (BR-001, FR-001, NFR-P-001, etc.)
   - Clear requirement statement
   - Acceptance criteria (testable)
   - Priority (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
   - Rationale

6. **Align with stakeholder goals and architecture principles**:
   - If stakeholder analysis exists, trace requirements back to stakeholder goals:
     - Example: "BR-001 addresses CFO's goal G-1: Reduce infrastructure costs 40% by end of Year 1"
     - Example: "NFR-P-001 supports Operations Director's outcome O-3: Maintain 99.95% uptime"
   - Reference relevant principles from `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md`:
     - Example: "NFR-S-001 aligns with Security by Design principle (SEC-001)"
   - Ensure high-priority stakeholder drivers get MUST requirements
   - Document which stakeholder benefits from each requirement

7. **Identify and resolve conflicting requirements**:
   - Review stakeholder analysis `conflict analysis` section for known competing drivers
   - Identify requirement conflicts that arise from stakeholder conflicts:
     - **Speed vs Quality**: CFO wants fast delivery vs Operations wants thorough testing
     - **Cost vs Features**: Finance wants minimal spend vs Product wants rich features
     - **Security vs Usability**: Security wants MFA vs Users want seamless experience
     - **Flexibility vs Standardization**: Business wants customization vs IT wants standards
   - For each conflict, document:
     - **Conflicting Requirements**: Which requirements are incompatible (e.g., FR-001 vs NFR-P-002)
     - **Stakeholders Involved**: Who wants what (e.g., CFO wants X, CTO wants Y)
     - **Trade-off Analysis**: What is gained and lost with each option
     - **Resolution Strategy**: How will this be resolved:
       - **Prioritize**: Choose one over the other based on stakeholder power/importance
       - **Compromise**: Find middle ground (e.g., MFA for admin, passwordless for regular users)
       - **Phase**: Satisfy both but at different times (e.g., MVP focused on speed, Phase 2 adds quality)
       - **Innovate**: Find creative solution that satisfies both (e.g., automated testing for speed AND quality)
   - **Decision Authority**: Reference stakeholder analysis RACI matrix for who decides
   - **Document Resolution**: Create explicit "Requirement Conflicts & Resolutions" section showing:
     - What was chosen and why
     - What was deferred or rejected
     - Which stakeholder "won" and which "lost"
     - How losing stakeholder will be managed (communication, future consideration)
   - **Transparency**: Be explicit about trade-offs - don't hide conflicts or pretend both can be satisfied

8. **Write the output**:
   - **CRITICAL - Token Efficiency**: Use the **Write tool** to create `projects/{project-dir}/requirements.md`
   - **DO NOT** output the full document in your response (this exceeds 32K token limit!)
   - Use the exact template structure
   - Include all sections even if some are TBD
   - MUST include "Requirement Conflicts & Resolutions" section if any conflicts exist

9. **Show summary only** (NOT the full document):

   After writing the file with Write tool, show ONLY this summary:

   ```markdown
   ## Requirements Complete âœ…

   **Project**: [Project Name]
   **File Created**: `projects/[PROJECT]/requirements.md`

   ### Requirements Summary

   **Total Requirements**: [Number]
   - Business Requirements (BR-xxx): [Number]
   - Functional Requirements (FR-xxx): [Number]
   - Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-xxx): [Number]
     - Performance (NFR-P-xxx): [Number]
     - Security (NFR-SEC-xxx): [Number]
     - Scalability (NFR-S-xxx): [Number]
     - Availability (NFR-A-xxx): [Number]
     - Compliance (NFR-C-xxx): [Number]
   - Data Requirements (DR-xxx): [Number]
   - Integration Requirements (INT-xxx): [Number]

   **Requirement Conflicts**: [Number] conflicts identified and resolved
   - [Brief summary of key conflicts and resolutions]
   - [Which stakeholders won/lost in conflicts]

   **Compliance Requirements**:
   - [List key compliance frameworks: PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.]

   **Key Gaps/TBDs**:
   - [List any major gaps that need follow-up]

   ### What's in the Document

   - Business Requirements with measurable success criteria
   - Functional Requirements organized by user journey
   - Non-Functional Requirements with specific targets
   - Data Requirements with GDPR considerations
   - Integration Requirements with third-party systems
   - Acceptance Criteria for each requirement
   - Requirements Traceability Matrix
   - Requirement Conflicts & Resolutions

   ### Next Steps

   - Review `requirements.md` for full details
   - [If DR-xxx exist]: Run `/arckit.data-model` to create comprehensive data model
   - [If no DR-xxx]: Run `/arckit.research` to research technology options
   ```

## Example Usage

User: `/arckit.requirements Create requirements for a payment gateway modernization project`

You should:
- Check for architecture principles
- Create project "payment-gateway-modernization" (gets number 001)
- Generate comprehensive requirements:
  - Business: Cost savings, improved conversion, reduced downtime
  - Functional: Payment processing, refunds, fraud detection, reporting
  - NFR: PCI-DSS compliance, 99.99% uptime, <2s response time, encryption
  - Integration: CRM, accounting system, fraud service
  - Data: Transaction records, PII handling, 7-year retention
- Write to `projects/001-payment-gateway-modernization/requirements.md`
- Confirm completion with summary

## Important Notes

- Requirements drive everything: SOW, vendor evaluation, design reviews, testing
- Be specific and measurable (avoid "fast", use "<2 seconds")
- Include WHY (rationale) not just WHAT
- Make acceptance criteria testable
- Flag compliance requirements clearly (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, etc.)
