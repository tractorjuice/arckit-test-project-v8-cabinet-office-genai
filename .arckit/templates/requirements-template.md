### Conflict C-1: [Conflict Name]

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- **Requirement A**: [Requirement ID and description] (e.g., FR-001: Launch MVP in 3 months)
- **Requirement B**: [Requirement ID and description] (e.g., NFR-Q-001: 95% test coverage before launch)

**Stakeholders Involved**:
- **Stakeholder A** (e.g., CEO): Wants Requirement A because [driver/goal] (e.g., competitive pressure, Q2 revenue target)
- **Stakeholder B** (e.g., CTO): Wants Requirement B because [driver/goal] (e.g., quality reputation, reduce production bugs)

**Nature of Conflict**:
- [Explain why both cannot be fully satisfied]
- Example: "3-month timeline insufficient to achieve 95% coverage and build all planned features"

**Trade-off Analysis**:

| Option | Pros | Cons | Impact |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Option 1**: Prioritize Speed (Launch in 3 months with 70% coverage) | ✅ Meet market window<br>✅ Early revenue | ❌ Higher bug risk<br>❌ Technical debt | CEO happy<br>CTO concerned |
| **Option 2**: Prioritize Quality (6 month launch with 95% coverage) | ✅ Quality reputation<br>✅ Lower production bugs | ❌ Miss market window<br>❌ Delayed revenue | CTO happy<br>CEO frustrated |
| **Option 3**: Compromise (4 months, 85% coverage, reduced scope) | ✅ Balance speed/quality<br>✅ Partial satisfaction | ❌ Neither fully satisfied<br>❌ Feature cuts needed | Both somewhat satisfied |
| **Option 4**: Innovate (3 months, automated testing, pair programming) | ✅ Speed AND quality<br>✅ Both satisfied | ❌ Higher upfront cost<br>❌ Team training needed | Both satisfied if works |

**Resolution Strategy**: [PRIORITIZE | COMPROMISE | PHASE | INNOVATE]

**Decision**: [What was chosen]
- Example: "Option 3 - Compromise: 4-month launch with 85% test coverage and reduced MVP scope"

**Rationale**: [Why this decision was made]
- Example: "Board approved 1-month timeline extension. CEO accepted delay for quality. CTO accepted 85% coverage threshold with commitment to reach 95% post-launch."

**Decision Authority**: [Who made the final decision]
- Reference stakeholder analysis RACI matrix
- Example: "Executive Sponsor (CEO) with input from Steering Committee"

**Impact on Requirements**:
- **Modified**: FR-001 changed from "3 months" to "4 months"
- **Modified**: NFR-Q-001 changed from "95% coverage" to "85% coverage at launch, 95% within 3 months post-launch"
- **Removed**: FR-015, FR-022, FR-031 (deferred to Phase 2)

**Stakeholder Management**:
- **CEO (Lost timeline)**: Communicated market analysis showing 4-month launch still captures 80% of opportunity. Committed to weekly progress updates.
- **CTO (Lost full coverage)**: Committed to post-launch quality sprint. Added NFR-Q-002: "Reach 95% coverage within 3 months of launch"

**Future Consideration**:
- Re-evaluate coverage target after 3 months of production data
- Deferred features (FR-015, FR-022, FR-031) prioritized for Phase 2

---

### Conflict C-2: [Another Conflict]

[Repeat structure for each conflict]

**Common Conflict Patterns**:

1. **Speed vs Quality**: Fast delivery vs thorough testing/documentation
   - Resolution strategies: MVP/phased, automated testing, pair programming

2. **Cost vs Features**: Budget constraints vs feature richness
   - Resolution strategies: prioritize must-haves, defer nice-to-haves, open-source alternatives

3. **Security vs Usability**: Strong security vs seamless user experience
   - Resolution strategies: risk-based controls, adaptive authentication, user segmentation

4. **Flexibility vs Standardization**: Custom solutions vs standard platforms
   - Resolution strategies: configurable platforms, plugin architecture, standard + exceptions process

5. **Innovation vs Stability**: New technology vs proven technology
   - Resolution strategies: pilot projects, hybrid approach, gradual migration

6. **Global vs Local**: Centralized control vs regional autonomy
   - Resolution strategies: federated model, global policies + local implementation, regional opt-ins
