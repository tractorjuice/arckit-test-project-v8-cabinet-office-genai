## I. Integration with SOBC

**How this Risk Register feeds into Strategic Outline Business Case (SOBC):**

### SOBC Strategic Case (Part A)
- **"Why Now?" section** uses strategic risks to demonstrate urgency
- **R-001** (STRATEGIC, 16): Demonstrates need for immediate action to address [strategic driver]

### SOBC Economic Case (Part B)
- **Risk-adjusted costs** use financial risks + HM Treasury optimism bias
- **R-004** (FINANCIAL, 9): ¬£2M budget risk ‚Üí Add 15% contingency (¬£300K)
- **R-009** (FINANCIAL, 8): Cost escalation risk ‚Üí Add 10% contingency (¬£200K)
- **Total risk contingency:** ¬£500K added to Economic Case costs

### SOBC Management Case (Part E - Risk Management)
- **Full risk register** included in Management Case Part E
- **Top 10 risks** highlighted with mitigation plans
- **Risk ownership matrix** demonstrates clear accountability
- **Monitoring framework** shows ongoing risk management capability

### SOBC Recommendation
- **High-risk profile** (60% exceeding appetite) may influence:
  - Option selection (prefer lower-risk options)
  - Phasing strategy (de-risk early phases first)
  - Go/no-go decision (if risk profile unacceptable)

| **High (13-19)** | Bi-weekly | Risk Owner | Project Board | Dashboard |
| **Medium (6-12)** | Monthly | Risk Owner | Project Manager | Exception report |
| **Low (1-5)** | Quarterly | Action Owner | Risk Owner | Status update |

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

**Leading Indicators** (predict future risk changes):
- [KRI 1: e.g., "Team turnover rate > 10% ‚Üí increases operational risk"]
- [KRI 2: e.g., "Vendor SLA breaches ‚Üí increases technology risk"]
- [KRI 3: e.g., "Budget variance > 5% ‚Üí increases financial risk"]

**Lagging Indicators** (confirm risk materialization):
- [KRI 4: e.g., "Defect rate > 5 per release ‚Üí technology risk realized"]
- [KRI 5: e.g., "Schedule delay > 2 weeks ‚Üí operational risk realized"]

### Escalation Criteria

**Automatic Escalation Triggers:**
1. Any risk increases by 5+ points
2. Any new Critical risk (score 20-25) identified
3. Any risk exceeds appetite and no mitigation plan
4. Any mitigation action delayed > 1 month
5. 3+ risks in same category exceed appetite

### Reporting Requirements

**Weekly** (Critical Risks Only):
- Dashboard to Steering Committee
- Narrative update on top 3 critical risks
- Action plan progress

**Monthly** (All Risks):
- Full risk register to Project Board
- Risk matrix visualization
- Risk appetite compliance summary
- Action plan status

**Quarterly** (Strategic Review):
- Risk register to Audit Committee (if applicable)
- Risk trend analysis (improving/deteriorating)
- Risk appetite threshold review
- Lessons learned and process improvements

### Risk Register Maintenance

**Risk Register Owner:** [Name, Role]

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain accuracy of risk register
- Coordinate risk reviews with risk owners
- Update risk scores based on evidence
- Track mitigation action completion
- Escalate risks per criteria
- Produce risk reports

**Update Process:**
1. Risk owners submit updates weekly (critical/high) or monthly (medium/low)
2. Risk register owner validates and updates register
3. PMO reviews for consistency and completeness
4. Steering Committee approves material changes

**Version Control:**
- Version increments with each update
- Change log maintained in Document Control section
- Previous versions archived for audit trail

## Appendix A: Risk Assessment Scales

### Likelihood Scale (1-5)

| Score | Rating | Probability | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Rare | < 5% | Highly unlikely, exceptional circumstances only |
| 2 | Unlikely | 5-25% | Could happen but probably won't, low probability |
| 3 | Possible | 25-50% | Reasonable chance, has happened before |
| 4 | Likely | 50-75% | More likely to happen than not, expected |
| 5 | Almost Certain | > 75% | Expected to occur, highly probable |

### Impact Scale (1-5)

| Score | Rating | Financial Impact | Schedule Impact | Stakeholder Impact | Description |
|-------|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Negligible | < ¬£50K | < 1 week | Minimal concern | Easily absorbed, routine management |
| 2 | Minor | ¬£50K-¬£200K | 1-4 weeks | Minor concern | Manageable within contingency |
| 3 | Moderate | ¬£200K-¬£500K | 1-2 months | Significant concern | Requires management effort and approval |
| 4 | Major | ¬£500K-¬£2M | 2-6 months | Severe concern | Threatens key objectives, difficult recovery |
| 5 | Catastrophic | > ¬£2M | > 6 months | Existential threat | Project failure, major stakeholder impact |

### Risk Score Matrix (Likelihood √ó Impact)

| Score Range | Risk Level | Color | Action Required |
|-------------|------------|-------|-----------------|
| 20-25 | Critical | üü• Red | Immediate escalation, senior management action |
| 13-19 | High | üüß Orange | Management attention, mitigation plan required |
| 6-12 | Medium | üü® Yellow | Management monitoring, consider mitigation |
| 1-5 | Low | üü© Green | Routine monitoring, accept or apply low-cost controls |

## Appendix B: Stakeholder-Risk Linkage

**Traceability from Stakeholders to Risks:**

| Stakeholder | Driver (from stakeholder-drivers.md) | Risk ID | Risk Title | Category | Score |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|---------|------------|----------|-------|
| CFO | D-001: Reduce costs (FINANCIAL, HIGH) | R-004 | Cloud costs exceed budget 40% | FINANCIAL | 9 |
| CFO | D-001: Reduce costs | R-009 | ROI not achieved due to low adoption | FINANCIAL | 8 |
