## Executive Summary

This document establishes the immutable principles governing all technology architecture decisions at [ORGANIZATION_NAME]. These principles ensure consistency, security, scalability, and alignment with business strategy across all projects and initiatives.

**Scope**: All technology projects, systems, and initiatives
**Authority**: Enterprise Architecture Review Board
**Compliance**: Mandatory unless exception approved by CTO/CIO

**Philosophy**: These principles are **technology-agnostic** - they describe WHAT qualities the architecture must have, not HOW to implement them with specific products. Technology selection happens during research and design phases guided by these principles.

## I. Strategic Principles

### 1. Scalability and Elasticity

**Principle Statement**:
All systems MUST be designed to scale horizontally to meet demand, with the ability to dynamically adjust capacity based on load.

**Rationale**:
Business demand is unpredictable and variable. Systems must handle both growth and traffic spikes without manual intervention or architectural changes.

**Implications**:
- Design for stateless components that can be replicated
- Avoid hard-coded limits or fixed capacity assumptions
- Plan for distributed deployment across multiple compute nodes
- Use load balancing to distribute traffic across instances
- Implement auto-scaling based on demand metrics

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] System can scale horizontally (add more instances)
- [ ] No single points of failure that limit scaling
- [ ] Load testing demonstrates capacity growth with added resources
- [ ] Scaling metrics and triggers defined
- [ ] Cost model accounts for variable capacity

---

### 2. Resilience and Fault Tolerance

**Principle Statement**:
All systems MUST gracefully degrade when dependencies fail and recover automatically without data loss or manual intervention.

**Rationale**:
Failures are inevitable in distributed systems. The architecture must assume failures will occur and design for resilience rather than perfect reliability.

**Implications**:
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Use timeouts on all network calls
- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when non-critical services fail
- Automated health checks and recovery
- Avoid cascading failures through bulkhead isolation

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Failure modes identified and mitigated
- [ ] Chaos engineering or fault injection testing performed
- [ ] Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) defined
- [ ] Automated failover tested
- [ ] Degraded mode behavior documented

---

### 3. Interoperability and Integration

**Principle Statement**:
All systems MUST expose functionality through well-defined, versioned interfaces using industry-standard protocols. Direct database access across system boundaries is prohibited.

**Rationale**:
Loose coupling through standard interfaces enables independent evolution, technology diversity, and system composability.

**Implications**:
- Use standardized protocols (HTTP REST, GraphQL, message queuing, event streaming)
- Version all interfaces with backward compatibility strategy
- Publish interface specifications (API contracts, event schemas)
- No direct database access across system boundaries
- Asynchronous communication for non-real-time interactions

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Interface specifications published (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL schema)
- [ ] Versioning strategy defined
- [ ] Authentication and authorization model documented
- [ ] Error handling and retry behavior specified
- [ ] No direct database coupling across systems

---

### 4. Security by Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Principle Statement**:
All architectures MUST implement defense-in-depth security with zero-trust principles. Security is NOT a feature to be added laterâ€”it is a foundational requirement.

**Rationale**:
The threat landscape requires assuming breach, eliminating implicit trust, and continuously verifying all access requests.

**Zero Trust Pillars**:
1. **Identity-Based Access**: No network-based trust; every request authenticated
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions, time-boxed where possible
3. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
4. **Continuous Verification**: Monitor, log, and analyze all access patterns

**Mandatory Controls**:
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication for all human access
- [ ] Service-to-service authentication (mutual TLS, signed tokens, or equivalent)
- [ ] Secrets management via secure vault (never in code or config files)
- [ ] Network segmentation with minimal trust zones
- [ ] Encryption at rest for all data stores
- [ ] Encrypted transport for all network communication
- [ ] Structured logging of all authentication/authorization events
- [ ] Regular security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)

**Compliance Frameworks**:
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework | ISO 27001 | SOC 2 Type II | CIS Controls]
- [GDPR | HIPAA | PCI-DSS | FedRAMP] (if applicable)

**Exceptions**:
- NONE. Security principles are non-negotiable.
- Specific control implementations may vary with compensating controls.

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Threat model completed and reviewed
- [ ] Security controls mapped to requirements
- [ ] Security testing plan defined
- [ ] Incident response runbook created

---

### 5. Observability and Operational Excellence

**Principle Statement**:
All systems MUST emit structured telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) enabling real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and capacity planning.

**Rationale**:
We cannot operate what we cannot observe. Instrumentation is a first-class architectural requirement, not an afterthought.

**Telemetry Requirements**:
- **Logging**: Structured logs with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: Request volume, latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99), error rates
- **Tracing**: Distributed trace context for request flows
- **Alerting**: Service Level Objective (SLO)-based alerting with actionable runbooks

**Required Instrumentation**:
- Request volume, latency distribution, error rate
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O, network)
- Business metrics (transactions, revenue impact, user actions)
- Security events (auth failures, policy violations, suspicious patterns)

**Log Retention**:
- **Security/audit logs**: As required by compliance (typically 1-7 years)
- **Application logs**: Sufficient for troubleshooting (typically 30-90 days)
- **Metrics**: Long-term trends (typically 1-2 years with aggregation)

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Logging, metrics, tracing instrumented
- [ ] Dashboards and alerts configured
- [ ] Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) defined
- [ ] Runbooks created for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Capacity planning metrics tracked

## II. Data Principles

### 6. Data Sovereignty and Governance

**Principle Statement**:
Data classification, residency, retention, and access controls MUST comply with regulatory requirements and corporate data governance policies.

**Data Classification Tiers**:
1. **Public**: No restrictions (marketing content, public documentation)
2. **Internal**: Employee-only access (internal documents, non-sensitive data)
3. **Confidential**: Need-to-know basis (financial data, PII, business secrets)
4. **Restricted**: Highest controls (regulated data: PHI, payment cards, classified information)

**Data Residency**:
- Personal data must reside in jurisdictions compliant with applicable regulations
- Cross-border data transfers require legal basis (adequacy decisions, standard contractual clauses)
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA, sector-specific) dictate storage locations

**Data Retention**:
- Automatic deletion after defined retention period
- Legal hold process for litigation/investigation
- Backup retention aligned with compliance and recovery requirements

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Data classification performed for all data stores
- [ ] Residency requirements mapped to infrastructure
- [ ] Retention policies configured with automated deletion
- [ ] Access controls enforce least privilege and need-to-know

---

### 7. Data Quality and Lineage

**Principle Statement**:
Data pipelines MUST maintain data quality standards and provide end-to-end lineage for auditability and troubleshooting.

**Quality Standards**:
- **Completeness**: No unexpected nulls in required fields
- **Consistency**: Cross-system data reconciliation
- **Accuracy**: Validation rules and constraints enforced at source
- **Timeliness**: Freshness Service Level Agreements (SLAs) defined and monitored

**Lineage Requirements**:
- Source-to-target mapping documented for all data flows
- Transformation logic version-controlled and reviewable
- Data quality metrics tracked per pipeline
- Impact analysis capability for schema changes

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Data quality rules defined and automated
- [ ] Lineage metadata captured and queryable
- [ ] Data contracts between producers and consumers
- [ ] Schema evolution strategy documented

---

### 8. Single Source of Truth

**Principle Statement**:
Every data domain MUST have a single authoritative source. Derived copies must be clearly labeled and synchronized.

**Rationale**:
Multiple authoritative sources create inconsistency, reconciliation overhead, and data integrity issues.

**Implications**:
- Identify the system of record for each data domain
- Derived/cached copies are read-only and clearly labeled as such
- Synchronization strategy defined for all derived copies
- Avoid bidirectional synchronization (creates split-brain scenarios)

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] System of record identified for each data entity
- [ ] Derived copies documented with sync frequency
- [ ] No bidirectional sync without conflict resolution strategy
- [ ] Master data management (MDM) strategy for shared reference data

---

## III. Integration Principles

### 9. Loose Coupling

**Principle Statement**:
Systems MUST be loosely coupled through published interfaces, avoiding shared databases, file systems, or tight runtime dependencies.

**Rationale**:
Loose coupling enables independent deployment, technology diversity, team autonomy, and system evolution without breaking dependencies.

**Implications**:
- Communicate through published APIs or asynchronous events
- No direct database access across system boundaries
- Each system manages its own data lifecycle
- Shared libraries kept minimal (favor duplication over coupling)
- Avoid distributed transactions across systems

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Systems communicate via APIs or events, not database
- [ ] No shared mutable state
- [ ] Each system has independent data store
- [ ] Deployment of one system doesn't require deployment of another
- [ ] Interface changes versioned with backward compatibility

---

### 10. Asynchronous Communication

**Principle Statement**:
Systems SHOULD use asynchronous communication for non-real-time interactions to improve resilience and decoupling.

**Rationale**:
Asynchronous patterns reduce temporal coupling, improve fault tolerance, and enable better scalability.

**When to Use Async**:
- Non-real-time business processes (order fulfillment, batch jobs)
- Event notification and pub/sub patterns
- Long-running operations that don't require immediate response
- Integration with unreliable or slow external systems

**When Synchronous is Acceptable**:
- Real-time user interactions requiring immediate feedback
- Query operations (read-only, idempotent)
- Transactions requiring immediate consistency

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Async patterns used for non-real-time flows
- [ ] Message durability and delivery guarantees defined
- [ ] Event schemas versioned and published
- [ ] Dead letter queues and error handling configured

---

## IV. Quality Attributes

### 11. Performance and Efficiency

**Performance Targets** (define for each system):
- **Response Time**: p50, p95, p99 latency targets
- **Throughput**: Requests per second, transactions per minute
- **Concurrency**: Simultaneous user/request capacity
- **Resource Efficiency**: CPU/memory utilization targets

**Implications**:
- Performance requirements defined before implementation
- Load testing performed before production deployment

- [ ] Backup and restore procedures validated

---

### 13. Maintainability and Evolvability

**Principle Statement**:
All systems MUST be designed for change, with clear separation of concerns, modular architecture, and comprehensive documentation.

**Rationale**:
Software spends most of its lifetime in maintenance. Design decisions should optimize for understandability and modifiability.

**Implications**:
- Modular architecture with clear boundaries
- Separation of concerns (business logic, data access, presentation)

---

## V. Development Practices

### 14. Infrastructure as Code

**Principle Statement**:
All infrastructure MUST be defined as code, version-controlled, and deployed through automated pipelines.

**Rationale**:
Manual infrastructure changes create drift, inconsistency, and undocumented state. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables repeatability, auditability, and disaster recovery.

**Implications**:
- All infrastructure defined in declarative code
- Infrastructure changes go through code review
- Environments are reproducible from code
- No manual changes to production infrastructure
- Infrastructure versioned alongside application code

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Infrastructure defined as code
- [ ] Infrastructure code version-controlled
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline for infrastructure
- [ ] No manual infrastructure changes in production

---

### 15. Automated Testing

**Principle Statement**:
All code changes MUST be validated through automated testing before deployment to production.

**Test Pyramid**:
- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, high coverage (70-80% of tests)
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions (15-20% of tests)
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user journeys (5-10% of tests)

**Required Test Types**:
- Functional tests (does it work?)
- Performance tests (is it fast enough?)
- Security tests (is it secure?)
- Resilience tests (does it handle failures?)

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Automated tests exist and pass before merge
- [ ] Test coverage meets defined thresholds
- [ ] Critical paths have end-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance tests run regularly

---

### 16. Continuous Integration and Deployment

**Principle Statement**:
All code changes MUST go through automated build, test, and deployment pipelines with quality gates at each stage.

**Pipeline Stages**:
1. **Source Control**: All changes committed to version control
2. **Build**: Automated compilation and packaging
3. **Test**: Automated test execution
4. **Security Scan**: Dependency and code vulnerability scanning
5. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to environments

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests must pass
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Code review approval required
- Deployment requires production readiness checklist

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline exists
- [ ] Pipeline includes security scanning
- [ ] Deployment is automated and repeatable
- [ ] Rollback capability tested

---

## VI. Exception Process
