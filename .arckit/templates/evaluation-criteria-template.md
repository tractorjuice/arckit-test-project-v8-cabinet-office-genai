## 5. Cost Evaluation

Cost proposals are opened **only for shortlisted vendors** after technical evaluation is complete.

### 5.1 Cost Scoring Methodology

**Method**: [SELECT ONE]

#### Option A: Lowest Price Best Value (Recommended)

- Other proposals scaled proportionally
- Formula: `Cost Score = (Lowest Price / Vendor Price) × 100`

#### Option B: Fixed Weight
- Cost is [30]% of total score
- Technical is [70]% of total score
- Final Score = (Technical Score × 0.70) + (Cost Score × 0.30)

#### Option C: Cost Reasonableness
- Each vendor scored on cost reasonableness (not purely lowest)
- Scoring based on value for money, not absolute price
- Consider: total cost, cost breakdown, value provided

### 5.2 Cost Evaluation Criteria (if using Option C)

| Criterion | Points | Evaluation Questions |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Total Cost Competitiveness** | 40 | How does total cost compare to budget and other vendors? |
| **Cost Breakdown Transparency** | 20 | Is cost breakdown detailed and transparent? Are costs justified? |
| **Value for Money** | 30 | Considering technical quality, is this good value? |
| **Payment Terms** | 10 | Are payment terms favorable and aligned with milestones? |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | |

### 5.3 Cost Analysis Template
