- Support costs (commercial support if open source)
- Migration costs (if replacing existing system)
- Exit costs (data export, migration if switching vendors)

**Risk-Adjusted TCO**:
- Add 20% contingency for build (scope creep, delays)
- Add 10% for vendor price increases (SaaS)
- Consider exit costs (switching vendors, vendor discontinuation)

### 11. Requirements Traceability

Map research findings back to requirements:

| Requirement | Research Category | Recommended Solution | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| FR-001: User login | Authentication | GOV.UK One Login (UK Gov) OR Auth0 (private sector) | Meets SSO, MFA requirements, GDPR compliant |
| FR-015: Payment processing | Payments | GOV.UK Pay (UK Gov) OR Stripe (private sector) | PCI-DSS compliant, low transaction fees |
| NFR-P-001: Database scalability | Database | AWS RDS PostgreSQL | Handles projected 1M records, auto-scaling |
| INT-003: CRM integration | Integration | Salesforce (already used) | Native API, existing vendor |

**Show coverage**:
- X% of requirements have identified solutions
- Y requirements need custom development (no suitable products)
- Z requirements need further research

### 12. Integration with Wardley Mapping

Research findings inform Wardley Map positioning:

**Value Chain Components by Evolution**:
- **Genesis** (novel, rare): Custom-built features (unique IP)
- **Custom** (built to order): Bespoke integrations, custom workflows
- **Product** (off-the-shelf): Commercial SaaS products (Stripe, Salesforce)
- **Commodity** (standard, ubiquitous): Cloud infrastructure (AWS S3, RDS), Open source (PostgreSQL)

**Strategic Guidance**:
- Commodities: Use managed services (AWS, Azure) or open source, don't build
- Products: Buy commercial SaaS unless strong rationale to build
- Custom: Build if no product exists or requirement is unique
- Genesis: Build if competitive advantage, otherwise wait for market to mature

### 13. Integration with SOBC Economic Case

Research feeds into Strategic Outline Business Case:

**Economic Case Input**:
- **Option Analysis**: Build vs Buy vs Adopt vs Do Nothing
- **Cost Estimates**: CAPEX (initial) vs OPEX (ongoing)
- **Benefits**: Quantified benefits from vendor claims (e.g., "Stripe increases conversion 15%")
- **Risks**: Vendor lock-in, price increases, vendor viability
- **Value for Money**: Preferred option based on TCO and benefits

**Example SOBC Options**:
- **Option 0**: Do Nothing (baseline)
- **Option 1**: Build custom (highest cost, most flexible)
- **Option 2**: Buy SaaS - Vendor A (medium cost, fast delivery)
- **Option 3**: Buy SaaS - Vendor B (low cost, limited features)
- **Option 4**: Adopt open source + managed service (low cost, engineering overhead)

Preferred option should align with research recommendation.

### 14. Write the Output

- Write to `projects/{project-dir}/research-findings.md`
- Use the exact template structure from `research-findings-template.md`
- Include all identified research categories (not a fixed list)
- Include build vs buy analysis for each category
- Include TCO comparison tables
- Include requirements traceability

### 15. Summarize What You Created

## Important Notes

- **Research is requirements-driven**: Only research categories relevant to actual requirements
- **Dynamic category detection**: DO NOT use a fixed category list, analyze requirements to identify needs
- **UK Government MUST use GOV.UK platforms** where they exist (One Login, Pay, Notify, Forms)
- **Digital Marketplace is preferred procurement route** for UK Government
- **Technology Code of Practice compliance** is mandatory for UK Government
- **Build vs Buy is strategic**: Consider TCO, time to market, team capabilities, competitive advantage
- **Open source is NOT free**: Factor in infrastructure, setup, maintenance, and support costs
- **TCO is 3 years minimum**: Include initial + ongoing costs
- **Vendor risk matters**: Startup vs established vendor, financial viability, lock-in
- **Exit strategy**: How easy is it to switch vendors or migrate data?
- **Integration effort**: Don't underestimate integration complexity
- **Research feeds into Wardley mapping**: Evolution axis informed by commodity vs product vs custom
