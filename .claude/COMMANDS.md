**Usage**:
```
/arckit.risk Identify risks for cloud migration project
/arckit.risk Create risk register for payment gateway modernization
/arckit.risk Assess risks for DWP benefits chatbot with stakeholder concerns
```

**What it does**:
- Creates `projects/NNN-project-name/risk-register.md`
- **Requires stakeholder analysis** (MANDATORY - every risk needs an owner from RACI matrix)
- Follows HM Treasury Orange Book 2023 framework (Part I: 5 Principles, Part II: Risk Control Framework)
- Identifies risks across 6 categories (Strategic, Operational, Financial, Compliance, Reputational, Technology)
- Assesses inherent risk (before controls) and residual risk (after controls)
- Applies 4Ts response framework (Tolerate, Treat, Transfer, Terminate)
- Links risks to stakeholder concerns and objectives
- Monitors risk appetite compliance
- Feeds into SOBC Management Case Part E

**Orange Book 2023 Framework**:

**Part I - Risk Management Principles**:
- **A. Governance and Leadership**: Risk owners from senior stakeholders
- **B. Integration**: Risks linked to objectives, business case, requirements
- **C. Collaboration**: Multiple perspectives from stakeholder analysis
- **D. Risk Processes**: Systematic identification, assessment, response, monitoring
- **E. Continual Improvement**: Regular reviews, KRIs, lessons learned

**Part II - Risk Control Framework (4-Pillar Structure)**:
- Risk appetite and tolerance thresholds
- Risk ownership and governance
- Risk assessment methodology (5×5 matrix)
- Control effectiveness measurement

**6 Risk Categories**:

1. **STRATEGIC**: Risks to strategic objectives, competitive position, policy changes
   - Example: "Strategic direction changes mid-project due to ministerial reshuffle"

2. **OPERATIONAL**: Risks to operations, service delivery, business continuity
   - Example: "Insufficient cloud expertise in team for migration"

3. **FINANCIAL**: Budget overruns, funding shortfalls, ROI not achieved
   - Example: "Cloud costs exceed budget by 40% due to poor estimation"

4. **COMPLIANCE/REGULATORY**: Non-compliance with laws, regulations, policies
   - Example: "GDPR breach due to international data transfer"

5. **REPUTATIONAL**: Damage to reputation, stakeholder confidence, public perception
   - Example: "High-profile service outage damages citizen trust"

6. **TECHNOLOGY**: Technical failure, cyber security, legacy system issues
   - Example: "Legacy integration fails under production load"

**Risk Assessment (5×5 Matrix)**:

**Inherent Risk** (before controls):
- **Likelihood** (1-5): Rare → Unlikely → Possible → Likely → Almost Certain
- **Impact** (1-5): Negligible → Minor → Moderate → Major → Catastrophic
- **Score** = Likelihood × Impact (1-25)

**Residual Risk** (after controls):
- Same scales applied after existing controls
- Shows control effectiveness (% risk reduction)

**Risk Zones**:
- 🟥 **Critical (20-25)**: Immediate escalation to senior management
- 🟧 **High (13-19)**: Management attention, mitigation plan required
- 🟨 **Medium (6-12)**: Management monitoring, consider mitigation
- 🟩 **Low (1-5)**: Routine monitoring, accept or low-cost controls

**4Ts Response Framework**:

Each risk receives ONE primary response:

- **TOLERATE**: Accept the risk (within appetite, cost of mitigation exceeds benefit)
  - When to use: Low residual score (1-5), within risk appetite
  - Example: "Minor UI inconsistency - aesthetic only, no functional impact"

- **TREAT**: Mitigate or reduce the risk (implement additional controls)
  - When to use: Medium/High risk that can be reduced through actions
  - Example: "Implement automated testing pipeline to reduce defect risk"

- **TRANSFER**: Transfer risk to 3rd party (insurance, outsourcing, contracts)
  - When to use: Low likelihood/high impact, can be insured or contracted away
  - Example: "Purchase cyber insurance for breach liability coverage"

- **TERMINATE**: Stop the activity creating the risk
  - When to use: High likelihood/high impact, exceeds appetite, cannot be mitigated
  - Example: "Cancel high-risk vendor contract, source alternative supplier"

**Complete Stakeholder Integration**:

Every risk must trace to stakeholder analysis:

```
Stakeholder: CFO (from stakeholder-drivers.md)
  → Driver D-001: Reduce costs (FINANCIAL, HIGH)
    → Risk R-004: Cloud costs exceed budget by 40% (FINANCIAL, Score: 9)
      → Risk Owner: CFO (from RACI matrix - Accountable)
        → Current Controls: Monthly cost reviews, FinOps dashboards
          → Residual Score: 9 (Medium, within appetite)
            → Response: TREAT - Implement automated cost anomaly alerts
              → Target Score: 6 (Low, well within appetite)
```

- Identifies orphan requirements (no design/implementation)
- Identifies orphan design elements (scope creep!)
- Calculates coverage metrics
- Flags critical gaps

**Traceability mapping**:
```
Requirement → HLD Component → DLD Module → Implementation → Tests → Status

Example:
FR-001 → PaymentService → PaymentController.processPayment() → payment.ts → TC-001, TC-002 → ✅
NFR-S-001 → SecurityArchitecture → TokenVault, Encryption → security/ → SEC-001-015 → ✅
BR-003 → [NO MAPPING] → [NO MAPPING] → [NO IMPLEMENTATION] → [NO TESTS] → ❌ GAP!
```

**Coverage metrics**:
- Business Requirements coverage
- Functional Requirements coverage
- Non-Functional Requirements coverage
- Coverage by priority (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- Overall traceability score (0-100)

**Gap analysis**:
- **Orphan Requirements**: Requirements without design (blocking!)
- **Orphan Design**: Design not tied to requirements (scope creep?)
- **Orphan Tests**: Tests not tied to requirements (what are they testing?)
- **Coverage Gaps**: Requirements without tests

**Outputs**:
- `projects/NNN-project-name/traceability-matrix.md` (full matrix)
- `projects/NNN-project-name/coverage-report.md` (metrics)
- `projects/NNN-project-name/gaps.md` (gap analysis)

**When to use**:
- After DLD approval (baseline)
- During implementation (track progress)
- Before release (go/no-go decision)
- For compliance audits (FDA, ISO, automotive)

## Best Practices

### 1. Follow the Workflow

Always follow the recommended sequence:
1. Principles FIRST (establishes governance)
2. Stakeholders SECOND (understand who cares and why)
3. Risk Assessment THIRD (identify and assess risks using Orange Book)
4. Business Case FOURTH (justify investment with SOBC using risk register)
5. Requirements FIFTH (if approved, define detailed requirements aligned to stakeholder goals)
6. Data Model SIXTH (create data model with ERD, GDPR compliance)
7. Wardley Mapping SEVENTH (strategic planning, build vs buy decisions)
8. SOW/RFP EIGHTH (procurement)
9. Evaluate vendors
10. HLD review (architecture gate)
11. DLD review (implementation gate)
12. Traceability (verification)

### 2. Keep Principles Updated

Architecture principles should be:
- Living documents (update as you learn)
- Specific enough to enforce
- Flexible enough to allow innovation
- Aligned with industry regulations

### 3. Be Thorough with Requirements

- Every requirement needs unique ID
- Every requirement needs acceptance criteria
- Every "MUST" requirement is mandatory
- Include WHY (rationale) not just WHAT

### 4. Make SOW Legally Sound

- Have legal review before sending to vendors
- Be specific and unambiguous
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Define change management process

### 5. Objective Vendor Evaluation

- Use documented criteria (no arbitrary scores)
- Reference specific requirements
- Document conflicts of interest
- Keep vendor proposals confidential

### 6. HLD is the Architecture Gate

- Implementation cannot start without HLD approval
- All architectural decisions happen here
- Changes after HLD approval require re-review
- Security and compliance are non-negotiable

### 7. DLD is the Implementation Gate

- Coding cannot start without DLD approval
- DLD must be detailed enough for ANY developer
- All ambiguities must be resolved
- Test strategy must be comprehensive

### 8. Maintain Traceability

- Update throughout project lifecycle
- Every MUST requirement MUST be traced to tests
- Use for impact analysis of change requests
- Required for compliance in regulated industries

## Troubleshooting

### "Architecture principles not found"

Run `/arckit.principles` first to establish governance rules.

### "Project doesn't exist"

The command will create the project automatically, or you can specify an existing project number.

### "HLD not approved yet"

DLD review requires HLD approval first. Complete HLD review and address all conditions.

### "Requirements not defined"

Run `/arckit.requirements` before generating SOW or evaluation criteria.

### "Gaps in traceability"

This is expected during implementation. Address CRITICAL gaps (MUST requirements without tests) before release.
