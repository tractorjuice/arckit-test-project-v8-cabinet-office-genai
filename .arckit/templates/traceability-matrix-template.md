## Document Purpose

[Brief description of what this document is for and how it will be used]

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) provides end-to-end traceability from business requirements through design, implementation, and testing. It ensures:
- All requirements are addressed in design
- All design elements trace to requirements
- All requirements are tested
- Coverage gaps are identified and tracked

### 1.2 Traceability Scope

This matrix traces:
```
Business Requirements (BR)
  ↓
Functional Requirements (FR)
  ↓
System Components (Design)
  ↓
Test Cases (TC)
```

## 2. Traceability Matrix

### 2.1 Forward Traceability: Requirements → Design → Tests

| BR ID | FR ID | Functional Requirement | Design Component | HLD Section | DLD Section | Test Case ID(s) | Status | Comments |
|-------|-------|------------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| BR-1 | FR-1 | [Requirement description] | [Service/Component] | [Section] | [Section] | TC-001, TC-002 | [✅ Covered \| ⚠️ Partial \| ❌ Gap] | |
| BR-1 | FR-2 | [Requirement description] | [Service/Component] | [Section] | [Section] | TC-003 | [✅ \| ⚠️ \| ❌] | |
| BR-2 | FR-3 | [Requirement description] | [Service/Component] | [Section] | [Section] | TC-004, TC-005 | [✅ \| ⚠️ \| ❌] | |
| BR-2 | FR-4 | [Requirement description] | [Service/Component] | [Section] | [Section] | - | [❌ Gap] | Test cases missing |
| BR-3 | FR-5 | [Requirement description] | Not yet designed | - | - | - | [❌ Gap] | Design not started |

**Legend**:
- ✅ **Covered**: Requirement fully addressed in design and tested
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Requirement partially addressed; needs clarification or additional work
- ❌ **Gap**: Requirement not addressed in design or testing

---

### 2.2 Backward Traceability: Tests → Design → Requirements

This ensures no "orphan" design elements or tests that don't trace to requirements.

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Design Component | FR ID | BR ID | Status | Comments |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| TC-001 | [Test description] | [Component] | FR-1 | BR-1 | [✅ Traced \| ⚠️ Unclear \| ❌ Orphan] | |
| TC-002 | [Test description] | [Component] | FR-1 | BR-1 | [✅ \| ⚠️ \| ❌] | |
| TC-003 | [Test description] | [Component] | FR-2 | BR-1 | [✅ \| ⚠️ \| ❌] | |
| TC-099 | [Test description] | [Component] | - | - | [❌ Orphan] | Test exists but no requirement - remove or trace |

## 3. Coverage Analysis

### 3.1 Requirements Coverage Summary

| Category | Total | Covered | Partial | Gap | % Coverage |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|-----|------------|
