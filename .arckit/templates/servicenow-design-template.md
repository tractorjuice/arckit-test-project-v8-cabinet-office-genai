## 2. CMDB Design

### Configuration Items
[Derive CI hierarchy from architecture diagrams - Context/Container/Component layers map to Business Service/Application/Infrastructure CIs]

| CI Name | CI Class | Parent CI | Owner | Environment |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| [Service Name] | Business Service | - | [Team] | PROD |

## 3. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

### Availability SLA
[Derive from NFRs]

| Service Tier | Availability | Max Downtime/Month |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | 99.95% | 21.9 minutes |
| Tier 2 | 99.9% | 43.8 minutes |
| Tier 3 | 99.5% | 3.65 hours |

### Performance SLA
[Derive from NFRs]

| Transaction Type | Target (p95) | Target (p99) |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| [API GET] | [<500ms] | [<1000ms] |
| [API POST] | [<1000ms] | [<2000ms] |

### Support Coverage

| Support Tier | Hours | On-Call | Response Times |
|--------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Critical (P1/P2) | 24/7 | Yes | P1: 15min, P2: 1hr |
| Standard (P3+) | Business hours | No | P3: 4hr, P4: 1 day |

## 4. Incident Management

### Priority Matrix

| Impact | Urgency High | Urgency Medium | Urgency Low |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | P1 (15min/4hr) | P2 (1hr/8hr) | P3 (4hr/24hr) |
| **High** | P2 (1hr/8hr) | P3 (4hr/24hr) | P4 (1d/3d) |
| **Medium** | P3 (4hr/24hr) | P4 (1d/3d) | P4 (1d/5d) |
| **Low** | P4 (1d/3d) | P4 (1d/5d) | P5 (2d/10d) |

### Assignment Groups

| Category | Subcategory | Assignment Group | Escalation |
|----------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| [Service]-Auth | Login Issues | [Team]-Auth-L2 | [Team]-Auth-L3 |
| [Service]-API | 5xx Errors | [Team]-Backend-L2 | [Team]-Backend-L3 |
| [Service]-DB | Performance | DBA-Support | DBA-Senior |

### P1 Response Runbook
1. **Detection** (0-5min): Auto-create incident, page on-call
2. **Response** (5-15min): Acknowledge, join incident bridge
3. **Diagnosis** (15-60min): Check dashboards, review logs
4. **Mitigation** (60-240min): Fix or rollback
5. **Resolution**: Verify, close incident, schedule PIR

## 5. Change Management

### Change Categories

| Type | Approval | Lead Time | Downtime |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Standard | Auto-approved | 1 hour | None |
| Normal | CAB | 5 days | Maintenance window |
| Emergency | ECAB | 2 hours | Allowed 24/7 |

### Maintenance Windows
- **Standard**: [Day] [Time UTC], e.g. Sunday 02:00-06:00 UTC
- **Blackout Periods**: [e.g., fiscal year-end, peak usage]

### Rollback Criteria
- [e.g., Error rate >5% for 10 minutes]
- [e.g., Response time >3s for 5 minutes]

## 6. Monitoring & Alerting

### Health Checks

| Component | Endpoint | Frequency | Alert Threshold |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| [App 1] | /health | 30s | HTTP non-200 OR >2s |

| Error Rate | >1% for 5min | P2 | Page on-call |
| Error Rate | >5% for 5min | P1 | Page on-call + manager |
| Response Time (p95) | >target for 10min | P3 | Create incident |
| CPU Usage | >80% for 15min | P3 | Auto-scale + alert |
