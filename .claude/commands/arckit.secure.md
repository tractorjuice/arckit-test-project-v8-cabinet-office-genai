# UK Government Secure by Design Assessment

You are helping to conduct a **Secure by Design assessment** for a UK Government technology project (civilian/non-MOD).

## Context

UK Government departments must follow NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) guidance and achieve appropriate security certifications before deploying systems. This assessment evaluates security controls using the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF).

**Key UK Government Security References**:
- NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)
- Cyber Essentials / Cyber Essentials Plus
- UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018
- Government Security Classifications Policy
- Cloud Security Principles

## Your Task

Generate a comprehensive Secure by Design assessment document by:

1. **Loading the template**: Use the UK Gov Secure by Design template from `.specify/templates/ukgov-secure-by-design-template.md`

2. **Understanding the project context**:
   - Department/organization (HMRC, DWP, Home Office, DEFRA, etc.)
   - Data classification (PUBLIC, OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE)
   - Project phase (Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live)
   - User base (public-facing, internal staff, both)
   - Hosting approach (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)

3. **Check existing documentation**:
   - Requirements documents in `specs/*/requirements.md`
   - Architecture diagrams in `specs/*/diagrams/`
   - Any existing security or compliance documents
   - TCoP assessments (if available)
   - Risk registers or threat models

4. **Assess security using NCSC CAF (14 principles across 4 objectives)**:

   **Objective A: Managing Security Risk (4 principles)**
   - A1: Governance - SIRO appointed, security policies, oversight
   - A2: Risk Management - Asset classification, risk register, treatment plans
   - A3: Asset Management - Inventory of hardware, software, data
   - A4: Supply Chain - Vendor assessments, contracts, third-party controls

   **Objective B: Protecting Against Cyber Attack (6 principles)**
   - B1: Service Protection Policies - Acceptable use, access control, data protection policies
   - B2: Identity and Access Control - MFA, PAM, least privilege, access reviews
   - B3: Data Security - Encryption, UK GDPR compliance, DPIA, DLP
   - B4: System Security - Patching, hardening, anti-malware, EDR
   - B5: Resilient Networks - Segmentation, firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPN
   - B6: Staff Awareness - Security training, phishing awareness, data protection

   **Objective C: Detecting Cyber Security Events (2 principles)**
   - C1: Security Monitoring - SIEM, alerting, logging, threat intelligence
   - C2: Proactive Security Event Discovery - Vulnerability scanning, pen testing, threat hunting

   **Objective D: Minimising the Impact of Incidents (2 principles)**
   - D1: Response and Recovery Planning - Incident response, BC/DR, RTO/RPO
   - D2: Improvements - Post-incident reviews, metrics, continuous improvement

5. **Assess Cyber Essentials compliance (5 controls)**:
   - Firewalls - Boundary firewalls configured
   - Secure Configuration - Hardened systems, unnecessary services disabled
   - Access Control - User accounts, MFA, least privilege
   - Malware Protection - Anti-malware on all devices
   - Patch Management - Timely patching (critical within 14 days)

6. **Assess UK GDPR compliance (if processing personal data)**:
   - DPO appointed (if required)
   - Lawful basis identified
   - Privacy notice published
   - Data subject rights procedures
   - DPIA completed (if high risk)
   - Data breach notification process (72 hours to ICO)
   - Records of Processing Activities (ROPA)

7. **For each CAF principle and control**:
   - Assess status: ✅ Achieved / ⚠️ Partially Achieved / ❌ Not Achieved / N/A
   - Gather evidence from project documents
   - Check relevant security controls
   - Identify gaps and risks
   - Provide specific remediation actions with owners and timelines

8. **Calculate overall CAF score**: X/14 principles achieved

9. **Identify critical security issues**:
   - Issues that block progression to next phase
   - Unacceptable risk levels
   - Regulatory non-compliance (UK GDPR, Data Protection Act)

10. **Generate actionable recommendations**:
    - Critical priority (0-30 days) - blockers for next phase
    - High priority (1-3 months) - significant risk reduction
    - Medium priority (3-6 months) - continuous improvement

11. **Save the document**: Write to `specs/[project-folder]/ukgov-secure-by-design.md`




**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 1: Generate Document ID
```bash
# Use the ArcKit document ID generation script
DOC_ID=$(.arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh "${PROJECT_ID}" "SECD" "1.0")
# Example output: ARC-001-SECD-v1.0
```

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):
- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., "001" from "projects/001-project-name")
- `[VERSION]` → Start with "1.0" for new documents
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → Use the document purpose (e.g., "Business and Technical Requirements")
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-SECD-v[VERSION]` → Use generated DOC_ID from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → Current command name (e.g., "arckit.secure")

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):
- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to "OFFICIAL" for UK Gov, "PUBLIC" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):
- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to "Project Team, Architecture Team" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.secure` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:
```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit.secure` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: [Read from .arckit/VERSION file or use "0.6.0"]
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### Example Fully Populated Document Control Section:

```markdown
## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | ARC-001-SECD-v1.0 |
| **Document Type** | {Document purpose} |
| **Project** | Windows 10 to Windows 11 Migration (Project 001) |
| **Classification** | OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE |
| **Status** | DRAFT |

- **Cyber Essentials is mandatory** for most government contracts
- **UK GDPR compliance is legally required** for personal data processing
- **SIRO sign-off required** for security risk acceptance
- **Data classification drives security controls** - OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE requires stronger controls
- **Penetration testing** recommended annually minimum
- **Incident response** - 72-hour reporting to ICO for personal data breaches
- **Cloud First** - prefer cloud hosting, assess against NCSC Cloud Security Principles
