**Benefits of GOV.UK Platforms**:
- ✅ Free or subsidized for public sector
- ✅ Pre-built, well-tested, accessible
- ✅ GDPR compliant, UK data residency
- ✅ Meets Service Standard and TCoP
- ✅ Reduces development and operational costs

### Digital Marketplace Procurement Strategy

**G-Cloud 14** (Cloud hosting, software, support):
- [X] suppliers found for [category]
- Top suppliers: [List with day rates or pricing]

**Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS)**:
- [X] suppliers found for [specialist role or outcome]
- Top suppliers: [List with day rates]

**Procurement Approach**:
1. Search Digital Marketplace for relevant categories
2. Shortlist 3-5 suppliers based on capability, price, past performance
3. Request further information or quotes
4. Award directly (if <£100K) or mini-competition (if >£100K)
5. Use framework terms (no custom contract negotiation)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Pre-approved suppliers (due diligence done)
- ✅ SME-friendly (1/3 spend with SMEs target)
- ✅ Fast procurement (no OJEU if under threshold)
- ✅ Framework terms enforced (fair pricing)

### Government Cloud and Data Residency

**Data Classification**: [OFFICIAL | OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE | SECRET]

**Hosting Requirements**:

**For OFFICIAL**:

- ✅ UK regions preferred but not required
- ✅ No special accreditation needed

**For OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE**:
- ✅ Public cloud acceptable with additional controls (encryption, logging, MFA)
- ⚠️ UK data residency may be required by department policy
- ⚠️ Consider Government Cloud (IL2) if mandated

**For SECRET**:
- ❌ Public cloud NOT acceptable
- ✅ Government Cloud (IL3+) OR air-gapped infrastructure required
- ✅ Security-cleared personnel required

**Recommended Approach for This Project**:
- [Public cloud (AWS UK region) | Government Cloud | Air-gapped]
- [Rationale based on data classification]

## Integration with Wardley Mapping

Research findings inform Wardley Map value chain positioning and evolution:

### Value Chain Components by Evolution

| Component | Evolution Stage | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| [Component 1] | Genesis (novel) | Build Custom | Unique IP, competitive advantage |
| [Component 2] | Custom | Build OR Buy Product | No clear commodity, build if differentiating |
| [Component 3] | Product | Buy SaaS | Mature products available (Stripe, Auth0) |
| [Component 4] | Commodity | Use Managed Service | Standard infrastructure (AWS S3, RDS) |

**Evolution Axis Guidance**:
- **Genesis** (left): Novel, rare, uncertain → Build if strategic, otherwise wait
- **Custom** (mid-left): Bespoke, emerging → Build if no product, buy if available
- **Product** (mid-right): Off-the-shelf, stabilizing → Buy SaaS unless strong rationale to build
- **Commodity** (right): Standard, ubiquitous → Use cloud/open source, don't build

**Strategic Insights**:
- [Insight 1]: [e.g., "Payments are commoditized - use Stripe, don't build"]
- [Insight 2]: [e.g., "ML recommendation engine is novel IP - build in-house"]
- [Insight 3]: [e.g., "Authentication is product - use Auth0 or GOV.UK One Login"]

**Next Steps**:
- Run `/arckit.wardley` to create Wardley Map with research findings
- Position components on evolution axis based on build/buy decisions
- Identify strategic plays (e.g., componentize novel features once mature)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Vendor Risks

**VR-1: Vendor Lock-in**
- **Risk**: Difficult or expensive to switch vendors after commitment
- **Impact**: HIGH - Could lead to price increases, feature stagnation
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**:

  - Escrow agreements for critical IP
  - Maintain ability to self-host if open core model

**VR-3: Price Increases**
- **Risk**: SaaS prices increase beyond budget over time
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Budget overruns, forced migration
- **Likelihood**: MEDIUM - SaaS vendors regularly increase prices 10-20%/year
- **Mitigation**:
  - Negotiate multi-year fixed pricing
  - Include price increase caps in contract (e.g., max 10%/year)
  - Budget 10-15% annual increase in TCO projections

### Technical Risks
