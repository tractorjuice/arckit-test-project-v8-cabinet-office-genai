## CRUD Matrix

**Purpose**: Shows which components/systems can Create, Read, Update, Delete each entity

| Entity | [Payment API] | [Admin Portal] | [Reporting Service] | [CRM Integration] | [Batch Jobs] | [Mobile App] |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| E-001: Customer | CR-- | CRUD | -R-- | -R-- | --U- | -R-- |
| E-002: Transaction | CR-- | -R-- | -R-- | -R-- | ---- | -R-- |
| E-003: PaymentMethod | CRUD | CRUD | -R-- | ---- | ---- | -R-- |
| E-004: RefundRequest | CR-- | CRUD | -R-- | ---- | --U- | CR-- |
| E-005: Merchant | ---- | CRUD | -R-- | CR-- | ---- | ---- |

**Legend**:
- **C** = Create (can insert new records)
- **R** = Read (can query existing records)
- **U** = Update (can modify existing records)
- **D** = Delete (can remove records)
- **-** = No access

**Access Control Implications**:
- Components with **C** access require input validation and business rule enforcement
- Components with **U** access require audit logging (before/after values)
- Components with **D** access require authorization checks and soft delete patterns
- Components with **R** only should use read-only database connections

**Security Considerations**:
- **Least Privilege**: Each component has minimum necessary permissions
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations (e.g., delete) restricted to admin roles
- **Audit Trail**: All CUD operations logged with timestamp, user, before/after values

## Data Quality Framework

### Quality Dimensions

#### Accuracy
**Definition**: Data correctly represents the real-world entity or event

**Quality Targets**:
| Entity | Attribute | Accuracy Target | Measurement Method | Owner |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| E-001: Customer | email | 99.5% valid emails | Bounce rate monitoring | Marketing Lead |
| E-001: Customer | phone | 95% valid phone numbers | Validation against telecoms DB | Customer Service |
| E-002: Transaction | amount | 100% accurate to penny | Reconciliation with bank statements | Finance Lead |

**Validation Rules**:
- **Email**: RFC 5322 format, MX record exists, not disposable domain
- **Phone**: E.164 format, valid country code, not invalid pattern (e.g., 00000000)
- **Amount**: Non-negative, max 2 decimal places, currency matches region

#### Completeness
**Definition**: All required data elements are populated

**Quality Targets**:
| Entity | Required Fields Completeness | Target | Current | Owner |
|--------|------------------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| E-001: Customer | first_name, last_name, email | 100% | [TBD] | Customer Service Lead |
| E-001: Customer | phone (optional) | 80% | [TBD] | Customer Service Lead |
| E-002: Transaction | All required fields | 100% | [TBD] | Finance Lead |

**Missing Data Handling**:
- **Required Fields**: Reject record creation if missing (hard validation)
- **Optional Fields**: Allow NULL, but track completeness % for reporting

#### Consistency
**Definition**: Data is consistent across systems and does not contradict itself

**Quality Targets**:
- **Cross-System**: Customer email in CRM matches email in Payment System (99.9% match rate)
- **Referential Integrity**: All foreign keys reference valid parent records (100%)
- **Business Rules**: Transaction amount matches sum of line items (100%)

**Reconciliation Process**:
- **Frequency**: Daily reconciliation between [This System] and [CRM, Data Warehouse]
- **Method**: Compare key fields (email, transaction totals) between systems
- **Discrepancy Resolution**: Automated sync if <0.1% variance, manual review if >0.1%

#### Timeliness
**Definition**: Data is up-to-date and available when needed

**Quality Targets**:
| Entity | Update Frequency | Staleness Tolerance | Current Latency | Owner |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|
| E-001: Customer | Real-time | <5 minutes | [TBD] | Integration Lead |
| E-002: Transaction | Real-time | <1 minute | [TBD] | Integration Lead |
| E-005: Merchant | Daily batch | <24 hours | [TBD] | Partner Integration Lead |

**Staleness Monitoring**:
- **Alert**: If data age exceeds staleness tolerance, alert data steward
- **Dashboard**: Real-time dashboard showing data freshness per entity

#### Uniqueness
**Definition**: No duplicate records exist (entity represents real-world object exactly once)

**Deduplication Rules**:
| Entity | Unique Key | Deduplication Logic | Duplicate Resolution |
|--------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| E-001: Customer | email | Case-insensitive email match | Merge records, keep oldest customer_id |
| E-002: Transaction | transaction_id | UUID uniqueness (guaranteed) | Cannot duplicate (primary key) |

| DR-008 | 7-year retention for financial records | E-002: Transaction | [All fields] | ✅ Implemented | Archive policy defined |

**Coverage Summary**:
- **Total DR Requirements**: [X]
- **Requirements Modeled**: [Y] (✅)
- **Requirements Partially Modeled**: [Z] (🟡)
- **Requirements Not Modeled**: [N] (❌)
- **Coverage %**: [Y/X * 100]%

**Gaps Identified**:
- [DR-XXX]: [Description of requirement not yet modeled] → **Action**: [Create entity E-XXX | Add attributes to E-YYY | Clarify requirement with stakeholder]

## Implementation Guidance

### Database Technology Recommendation

**Recommended Database**: [PostgreSQL | MySQL | MongoDB | DynamoDB | Neo4j | Multi-model]

**Rationale**:
- **Relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL)**: Recommended for transactional data with strong ACID guarantees
  - Use Case: E-001 (Customer), E-002 (Transaction), E-003 (PaymentMethod)
  - Benefits: Referential integrity, ACID transactions, mature tooling, SQL standards
- **Document (MongoDB, DynamoDB)**: Consider for flexible schemas, high write throughput
  - Use Case: E-XXX (Event logs, audit trails)
  - Benefits: Schema flexibility, horizontal scaling, high availability
- **Graph (Neo4j)**: Consider for highly connected data (social networks, fraud detection)
  - Use Case: E-XXX (Relationship graphs, recommendation engines)
  - Benefits: Traverse relationships efficiently, pattern matching
- **Time-Series (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)**: Consider for metrics, events, IoT data
  - Use Case: E-XXX (System metrics, transaction metrics)
  - Benefits: Time-based queries, automatic downsampling, compression

**Chosen Technology**: [PostgreSQL 15+]
- **Justification**: [Strong ACID guarantees for financial transactions, excellent JSON support for flexible attributes, mature ecosystem, GDPR compliance tooling]
- **Cloud Provider**: [AWS RDS | Azure Database for PostgreSQL | Google Cloud SQL]
- **High Availability**: [Multi-AZ deployment | Read replicas | Failover strategy]

---

### Schema Migration Strategy

**Migration Tool**: [Flyway | Liquibase | Alembic | Django Migrations | Custom scripts]

**Versioning**:
- **Schema Version**: [V1.0.0] (semantic versioning)
- **Migration Scripts**: Stored in `db/migrations/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `V[version]__[description].sql` (e.g., `V1.0.0__create_customer_table.sql`)

**Migration Process**:
1. **Development**: Create migration script in local environment
2. **Testing**: Run migration on test database, verify data integrity
3. **Peer Review**: Code review of migration script (check for data loss, performance impact)
4. **Staging**: Deploy migration to staging environment, run smoke tests
5. **Production**: Deploy migration during maintenance window (or zero-downtime if possible)
6. **Rollback Plan**: Document rollback procedure for each migration (undo script)

**Zero-Downtime Migrations** (where possible):
- **Additive Changes**: Add new columns/tables without dropping old ones (backward compatible)
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Maintain two schemas, switch over when migration complete
- **Avoid**: Rename columns, drop columns, change data types (requires downtime or complex migration)

---

### Backup and Recovery

**Backup Strategy**:
- **Full Backup**: Daily at 02:00 UTC
- **Incremental Backup**: Every 6 hours
- **Transaction Log Backup**: Continuous (WAL archiving for PostgreSQL)
- **Backup Retention**: 30 days online, 7 years archival (for compliance)

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: <1 hour (max data loss tolerable)

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: <4 hours (max downtime tolerable)

**Disaster Recovery**:
- **Multi-Region Replication**: [ENABLED | DISABLED]
- **Failover**: Automated failover to secondary region if primary fails
- **DR Testing**: Quarterly DR drills to validate recovery procedures

**Backup Security**:
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all backups
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS for backup transfers
- **Access Control**: Only DBA team can restore backups

---

### Data Archival

**Archival Policy**:
- **Active Data**: Data accessed frequently (last 3 years) → Hot storage (SSD)
- **Archived Data**: Data accessed rarely (3-7 years old) → Cold storage (S3 Glacier, Azure Archive)
- **Deleted Data**: Data past retention period → Permanently deleted or anonymized

**Archival Process**:
1. **Identification**: Monthly batch job identifies records older than active retention period
2. **Export**: Export records to cold storage in compressed format (Parquet, Avro)
3. **Deletion**: Delete from hot storage after successful export and verification
4. **Indexing**: Maintain metadata index in hot storage for retrieval (entity ID, archive location)

**Retrieval Process**:
- **Retrieval SLA**: Restore archived data within 24 hours (for compliance requests, litigation hold)
- **Cost**: Archival reduces storage costs by ~90% compared to hot storage

---

### Testing Data Strategy

**Test Data Requirements**:
- **Volume**: [10% | 50% | 100%] of production data volume for performance testing
- **Diversity**: Cover all entity types, edge cases, valid/invalid data

**Data Anonymization** (for non-production environments):
- **PII Masking**:
  - `email`: Replace with `test_<random>@example.com`
  - `first_name`, `last_name`: Replace with random names from faker library
  - `phone`: Replace with valid but fake phone numbers
  - `address`: Replace with valid but fake addresses
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintain relationships (foreign keys) while masking
- **Consistency**: Mask deterministically (same real email always maps to same fake email)

**Test Data Generation**:
- **Synthetic Data**: Use tools like [Faker | Mockaroo | custom scripts] to generate fake data
- **Production Copy**: Copy production data to staging, then anonymize PII
- **Prohibited**: Never use real PII in development or test environments

**Test Data Refresh**:
- **Frequency**: Monthly refresh of test data from production (anonymized)
- **Automation**: Automated pipeline to copy, anonymize, and load test data
