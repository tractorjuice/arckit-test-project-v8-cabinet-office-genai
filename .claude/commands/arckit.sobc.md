description: Create Strategic Outline Business Case (SOBC) using UK Government Green Book 5-case model
---

You are helping an enterprise architect create a Strategic Outline Business Case (SOBC) to justify investment in a technology project.

## About SOBC

A **Strategic Outline Business Case (SOBC)** is the first stage in the UK Government business case lifecycle:
- **SOBC**: Strategic Outline (this command) - High-level case for change, done BEFORE detailed requirements
- **OBC**: Outline Business Case - After some design work, with refined costs
- **FBC**: Full Business Case - Detailed case with accurate costs, ready for final approval

This command creates the **SOBC** - the strategic case to secure approval to proceed with requirements and design.

## Instructions

This command creates a **Strategic Outline Business Case (SOBC)** following HM Treasury Green Book 5-case model. This is a high-level justification done BEFORE detailed requirements to secure approval and funding.

**When to use this:**
- **After**: `/arckit.stakeholders` (MANDATORY - SOBC must link to stakeholder goals)
- **Before**: `/arckit.requirements` (SOBC justifies whether to proceed with detailed requirements)
- **Purpose**: Secure executive approval and funding to proceed to next stage

**Note**: Later stages will create OBC (Outline Business Case) and FBC (Full Business Case) with more accurate costs. This SOBC uses strategic estimates and options analysis.

1. **Check for prerequisites**:
   - **MANDATORY**: Check if stakeholder analysis exists for this project
     - Read `.arckit/memory/` or `projects/*/stakeholder-drivers.md` to find it
     - If NO stakeholder analysis exists, STOP and tell user:
       "⚠️ SOBC requires stakeholder analysis. Run `/arckit.stakeholders` first to identify who benefits and why."
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Check if architecture principles exist
     - Read `.arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md`
     - If exists, use for strategic alignment
   - **OPTIONAL**: Check if requirements exist
     - If exists, use for more accurate estimates
     - If not, use high-level cost estimates

2. **Understand the request**: The user may be:
   - Creating initial SOBC (most common)
   - Updating existing SOBC with new information
   - Creating UK Government Green Book 5-case model (automatic for UK projects)
   - Evaluating multiple strategic options

3. **Determine project context**:
   - If user mentions "UK Government", "public sector", "department", "ministry" → Use full Green Book format
   - Otherwise → Use Green Book structure but adapt language for private sector
   - Check stakeholder analysis for government-specific stakeholders (Minister, Permanent Secretary, Treasury, NAO)

4. **Read stakeholder analysis carefully**:
   - Extract ALL stakeholder goals (these become benefits!)
   - Extract stakeholder drivers (these explain WHY project needed)
   - Extract conflicts (these become risks/mitigations)
   - Extract outcomes (these become success criteria)
   - Note: EVERY benefit in SOBC MUST trace to a stakeholder goal

5. **Generate comprehensive SOBC** following the template at `.arckit/templates/sobc-template.md`:

   **Five Cases (HM Treasury Green Book Model)**:

   **A. Strategic Case**:
   - **Problem Statement**: What's broken? (from stakeholder pain points)
   - **Strategic Fit**: How does this align with organizational strategy?
   - **Stakeholder Drivers**: Map to stakeholder analysis
     - Link EACH driver to strategic imperative
     - Show intensity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
   - **Scope**: What's in/out of scope (high-level)
   - **Dependencies**: What else must happen?
   - **Why Now?**: Urgency and opportunity cost

   **B. Economic Case**:
   - **Options Analysis** (CRITICAL):
     - Option 0: Do Nothing (baseline)
     - Option 1: Minimal viable solution
     - Option 2: Balanced approach (often recommended)
     - Option 3: Comprehensive solution
     - For EACH option:
       - High-level costs (rough order of magnitude)
       - Benefits delivered (% of stakeholder goals met)
       - Risks
       - Pros/cons
   - **Benefits Mapping**:
     - Link EACH benefit to specific stakeholder goal from stakeholder-drivers.md
     - Quantify where possible (use stakeholder outcomes for metrics)
     - Categorize: FINANCIAL | OPERATIONAL | STRATEGIC | COMPLIANCE | RISK
   - **Cost Estimates** (high-level):
     - Capital costs (build)
     - Operational costs (run)
     - 3-year TCO estimate
   - **Economic Appraisal**:
     - Qualitative assessment (this is strategic, not detailed)
     - Expected ROI range
     - Payback period estimate
   - **Recommended Option**: Which option and why

   **C. Commercial Case**:
   - **Procurement Strategy**:
     - UK Government: Digital Marketplace route (G-Cloud, DOS, Crown Hosting)
     - Private Sector: Build vs Buy vs Partner
   - **Market Assessment**:
     - Supplier availability
     - SME opportunities (UK Gov requirement)
     - Competition considerations
   - **Sourcing Route**: How will we acquire this?
   - **Contract Approach**: Framework, bespoke, managed service?

   **D. Financial Case**:
   - **Budget Requirement**: How much needed?
   - **Funding Source**: Where does money come from?
   - **Approval Thresholds**: Who must approve?
     - UK Gov: HMT approval needed above £X?
     - Private: Board approval needed?
   - **Affordability**: Can organization afford this?
   - **Cash Flow**: When do we need money?
   - **Budget Constraints**: Any spending controls?

   **E. Management Case**:
   - **Governance**:
     - Who owns this? (from stakeholder RACI matrix)
     - Steering committee membership
     - Decision authorities
   - **Project Approach**: Agile? Waterfall? Phased?
   - **Key Milestones**:
     - Approval gates
     - Major deliverables
     - Go-live target
   - **Resource Requirements**:
     - Team size (estimate)
     - Skills needed
     - External support
   - **Change Management**:
     - Stakeholder engagement plan (from stakeholder analysis)
     - Training needs
     - Resistance mitigation (from stakeholder conflict analysis)
   - **Benefits Realization**:
     - How will we measure success? (use stakeholder outcomes)
     - Who monitors benefits?
     - When do we expect to see benefits?
   - **Risk Management**:
     - Top 5-10 strategic risks
     - Mitigation strategies
     - Risk owners (from stakeholder RACI)

6. **Ensure complete traceability**:

   Every element must link back to stakeholder analysis:

   ```
   Stakeholder Driver D-1 (CFO: Reduce costs - FINANCIAL, HIGH)
     → Strategic Case: Cost pressure driving change
       → Economic Case: Benefit B-1: £2M annual savings (maps to CFO Goal G-1)
         → Financial Case: 18-month payback acceptable to CFO
           → Management Case: CFO sits on steering committee (RACI: Accountable)
             → Success Criterion: CFO Outcome O-1 measured monthly
   ```

7. **Include decision framework**:
   - **Recommendation**: Which option to proceed with?
   - **Rationale**: Why this option? (reference stakeholder goals met)
   - **Go/No-Go Criteria**: Under what conditions do we proceed?
   - **Next Steps**: If approved, what happens next?
     - Typically: `/arckit.requirements` to define detailed requirements
     - Then: `/arckit.business-case-detailed` with accurate costs

8. **Write the output**:
   - Create or update `projects/NNN-project-name/sobc.md`
   - Use project directory structure (create if doesn't exist)
   - File name pattern: `sobc.md` (Strategic Outline Business Case)
   - Later stages will be: `obc.md` (Outline Business Case), `fbc.md` (Full Business Case)


**IMPORTANT - Populate Metadata Footer**:
Before completing, populate the metadata footer at the end of the generated document with:
- `[DATE]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[VERSION]` → Current ArcKit version from `.arckit/VERSION` file or "0.6.0"
- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → The actual project name
- `[AI_MODEL]` → The AI model used (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "gpt-4", "gemini-pro")

Example populated footer:
```markdown

**ArcKit Version**: v0.6.0
**Project**: Windows 10 to Windows 11 Migration using Microsoft InTune (Project 001)
**Model**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```


9. **Use appropriate language**:
   - **UK Government**: Use Green Book terminology (intervention, public value, social benefit, spending controls)
   - **Private Sector**: Adapt to commercial language (investment, shareholder value, competitive advantage)
   - **Always**: Link to stakeholder analysis for credibility

10. **Flag uncertainties**:
    - Mark estimates as "Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)"
    - Flag where more analysis needed
    - Note dependencies on external factors
    - Recommend sensitivity analysis for key assumptions

## Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Technology Modernization**:
- Strategic Case: Legacy systems failing, stakeholder frustration high
- Economic Case: 3-5 options from do-nothing to complete rebuild
- Commercial Case: Cloud migration, Digital Marketplace G-Cloud
- Financial Case: £2-5M over 3 years, CFO approval needed
- Management Case: Phased migration, minimal disruption

**Pattern 2: New Digital Service**:
- Strategic Case: Citizen/customer demand, competitive pressure
- Economic Case: MVP vs full-featured comparison
- Commercial Case: Build in-house vs platform vendor
- Financial Case: £500K-2M year 1, ongoing £200K/year
- Management Case: Agile delivery, beta to live

**Pattern 3: Compliance/Risk Driven**:
- Strategic Case: Regulatory requirement, audit findings
- Economic Case: Minimum compliance vs best practice
- Commercial Case: Specialist vendors, certification needed
- Financial Case: Non-negotiable spend, insurance cost reduction
- Management Case: Deadline-driven, stakeholder compliance team owns

## UK Government Specific Guidance

   - Public value (not just efficiency, but citizen outcomes)
   - Minister/Permanent Secretary drivers
   - Parliamentary accountability

2. **Economic Case includes**:
   - Social Cost Benefit Analysis (if required)
   - Green Book discount rates (3.5% standard)
   - Optimism bias adjustment (add contingency)
   - Wider economic benefits

3. **Commercial Case includes**:

   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance)
   - Data protection (ICO/DPIA requirements)

## Error Handling

If stakeholder analysis doesn't exist:
- **DO NOT proceed** with SOBC
- Tell user: "SOBC requires stakeholder analysis to link benefits to stakeholder goals. Please run `/arckit.stakeholders` first."

If user wants detailed business case:
- Tell user: "This command creates SOBC (Strategic Outline Business Case) - the first stage with high-level estimates. After `/arckit.requirements`, create OBC (Outline Business Case) with refined costs. After design, create FBC (Full Business Case) for final approval."

If project seems too small for full 5-case:
- Still use 5-case structure but scale appropriately
- Smaller projects: 2-3 pages per case
- Major programmes: 10-20 pages per case

## Template Reference

Use the template at `.arckit/templates/sobc-template.md` as the structure. Fill in with:
- Stakeholder analysis data (goals, drivers, outcomes, conflicts)
- Architecture principles (strategic alignment)
- User's project description
- Industry/sector best practices
- UK Government guidance (if applicable)

## Output Instructions

**CRITICAL - Token Efficiency**:
